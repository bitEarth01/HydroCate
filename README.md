# HydroCate
This project is made for Nasa Space App Challange 2023 for the task-"Everything Starts with Water"

### High-Level Project Summary

Our educational app utilizes NASA's mission data to explore the complex interplay between the water cycle and climate change. It's designed to cater to students of all ages, providing interactive content that illustrates how climate change factors influence the water cycle. By presenting information in an engaging and user-friendly manner, the app equips students with the knowledge and tools needed to comprehend these crucial environmental processes. Users gain a deep understanding of the Earth's climate system and the vital role played by the water cycle.This App was developed using Flutter Framework. This application is a cross-platform application.

### DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION

What does our app do ?

Our App Gives us a lot of climate data based on the location the user inputs on the interactive map, along with explaining the process of water cycle and about nasa missions illustratively and summarized versions.

### What tools, coding languages, hardware, or software did we use to develop our project?

The app is built using the Flutter framework, with coding in the Dart programming language,By integrating these tools and technologies, our app aims to achieve several key objectives. First and foremost, we seek to bridge the gap between scientific data and accessible education, making complex concepts comprehensible to users of all ages. Furthermore, we hope to raise awareness about the profound impact of climate change on the water cycle, promoting environmental responsibility and conservation.

### Future of our App
Ultimately, our project strives to empower students and learners to become informed and responsible stewards of our environment. Through the use of engaging content and interactive features, we aim to inspire a deeper appreciation for the Earth's delicate balance and the importance of mitigating climate change's effects on the water cycle. We are planning on making a much more interactive and illustrative explanation about the nasa missions to K-12 Students.
